# 🍳 Recipe Website Project

## 📖 Introduction
This project is a **Recipe Website** built to showcase a collection of delicious recipes, presented in a clean and user-friendly way. The website allows users to browse different categories of meals, view detailed recipe pages, and explore ingredients and preparation steps.

The main goal of this project is to practice **front-end web development** skills while focusing on structure, design, and usability. By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated my ability to build a fully functional, visually appealing, and responsive web application.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Design and develop a multi-page recipe website using **HTML**, **CSS**, and optionally **JavaScript**.
- Implement consistent and semantic HTML structure.
- Apply responsive design principles to make the website accessible on various devices.
- Use clean and organized CSS for layout and styling.
- Optionally, add interactivity (such as filtering recipes or a dark/light mode toggle).

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
By completing this project, I will have developed and reinforced the following skills:
- Structuring web content using **semantic HTML5**.
- Styling websites effectively using **CSS3** and **Flexbox/Grid**.
- Building responsive layouts for mobile and desktop.
- Managing project files and version control with **Git** and **GitHub**.
- Writing clear documentation (like this README).

## 🚀 Future Improvements
After the initial version is completed, I plan to:
- Add a **search feature** for recipes.
- Include **JavaScript functionality** for dynamic content loading.
- Integrate **a backend or API** for storing and retrieving recipes.

## 🧩 Reflection (Optional – at the end of the project)
This project helped me better understand how to plan and structure a front-end application. I learned how to apply CSS to create consistent, visually appealing layouts and how to use Git for version control. It also gave me confidence in writing documentation and presenting my work clearly.
